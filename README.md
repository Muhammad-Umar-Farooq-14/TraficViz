 The first is to spot the exact site of the accident with the help of GPS and it will also determine the  seriousness of the occurred accident via accelerometer. The accident information will be sent to  the nearby police station and medical assistance station through an android mobile application with  the exact map location and severity of the accident.  The goal of this plan is to reduce traffic delays and ensure that emergency vehicles can move  freely. The idea behind this plan is to automatically green the traffic light in the ambulance's path  so that the ambulance may arrive on time and save lives. The ambulance is located by mail on the  main server's computer. Meanwhile, it regulates the traffic signal following the ambulance's  location, allowing it to reach the hospital promptly. A fully automated system locates emergency  vehicles and manages traffic signals, allowing patients to get to the hospital on time.
